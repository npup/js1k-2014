js1k-2014
=========

This is my js1k entry of 2014. It is a version of the popular "2048" game, in 1020 bytes.

Move tiles 

Play with cursor keys when available, or by touching the two middle tiles in the top/right/bottom/left set if on a touch screen device. Complete the game by obtaining a "2048" tile. If the grid is choked with tiles, you lose.
The score is diplayed in the document's title, and is also alerted when the game ends. reload the page to play again.

Works on IE9+ and also touch screens.
